# Sorting visual
## How to implement your own sorting algorithm
 - Take the provided compiled jar file and add it to your dependencies in your IDE
 - Create a Main-Class with a main-method to start the program. The method should look like the one provided in the examples
 - For each of your sorting algorithms, create a class extending the Algorithm-class and implement the required methods (see examples)
 - Run your project, Have fun !

## Todos
 - ~Update to the BarChart used as a SortingDisplay~
 - ~Implement loading plugins~
 - ~Implement the SortingWindowController~
 - ~Fix Timer control~
 - ~Fix window sizing issue~
 - ~Fix Algorithm constructor overengineering~
 - ~Impl InputHandler~

## Loading of custom Algorithms
 - This project is a libary
 - Add it to BlueJ or any other IDE as a dependency
 - Make your CustomAlgorithms extend our Algorithm class
 - using out AlgorithmLoader.registerAlgorithm method to register all of your custom Algorithms
 - Execute our main method in your main method
